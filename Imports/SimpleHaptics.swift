  ///
  /// The cases represent different types of feedback that are used in specific situations:
  ///
  /// Selection Haptic - is used to give user feedback when a selection changes.
  ///
  /// - `selection`: Provides a gentle tap, useful for indicating changes in selection status.
  ///
  /// Notification Haptic - is used to give user feedback when an notification is displayed.
  ///
  /// - `success`: Denotes the successful completion of an action, allowing users to receive positive
  ///              confirmation.
  ///
  /// - `warning`: Signals a warning or impending event, helping to draw the user's attention.
  ///
  /// - `error`: Communicates that an error has occurred, providing an immediate and noticeable alert.
  ///
  /// Impact Haptic is used to give user feedback when an impact between UI elements occurs.
  ///
  /// - `light`: Produces a light impact feedback, slightly stronger than `selection`, useful for enhancing UI
  ///            interactions.
  ///
  /// - `medium`: Generates a medium impact feedback, stronger than `light`.
  ///
  /// - `heavy`: Triggers a heavy impact feedback, stronger than `medium`.
  ///
  /// - `soft`: Initiates a soft impact feedback, available from iOS 13 onwards.
  ///
  /// - `rigid`: Elicits a rigid impact feedback, available from iOS 13 onwards.
  ///
  /// Note: The `soft` and `rigid` haptic feedback types are silently ignored on devices running iOS versions
  /// prior to 13.

  /// Asynchronously generates haptic feedback using a new Task.
  ///
  /// This function creates a new Task to call the `generate(_:)` function asynchronously. This function is
  /// particularly valuable when you need to trigger haptic feedback within a synchronous
  /// context, as it allows the haptic feedback to be generated without blocking the current execution flow.
  ///
  /// The function returns the created Task, but the result can be safely discarded if not needed.
  ///
  /// Like the `generate(_:)` function, it is safe to call this function on any version of iOS without
  /// checking availability. On devices that don't support the specified haptic type, this function silently
  /// fails.
  ///
  /// Notice that the soft impact and rigid impact are only supported since iOS 13.
  ///
  /// - Parameter hapticType: The type of haptics to generate.
  /// - Returns: A Task that, when awaited, will generate the specified haptic feedback. The return value can be
  /// ignored without a warning due to the `@discardableResult` attribute, but please note that it won't be
  /// possible to cancel the Task without keeping a reference to it, should there be any reason to do so.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// let task = Haptics.generateTask(.success)
  /// // The task can be discarded without warning, but it also can be cancelled if necessary
  /// task.cancel()
  /// ```
  ///
  /// - SeeAlso: `generate(_:)`

  /// Asynchronously generates haptic feedback.
  ///
  /// This function allows you to generate different types of haptic feedback in an asynchronous context,
  /// ensuring the main thread remains responsive.
  ///
  /// It is safe to call this function on any version of iOS from iOS 10 onwards without checking
  /// availability. On devices or iOS versions that do not support the specified haptic type, this function
  /// silently fails, resulting in no feedback.
  ///
  /// Note that the `.soft` and `.rigid` haptic types are only supported on devices running iOS 13 or later.
  ///
  /// - Parameter hapticType: The type of haptics to generate, specified by the `HapticType` enumeration.

  /// Example of usage:
  /// ```swift
  /// Task {
  ///     await Haptics.generate(.success)
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// In case of the main task being cancelled while the haptic feedback is being generated, the feedback
  /// generation will be interrupted and no error will be thrown.
