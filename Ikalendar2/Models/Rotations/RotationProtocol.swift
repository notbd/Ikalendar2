/// Protocol that defines the requirements for a rotation.

/// A rotation event has a unique identifier, a time range during which it occurs,
/// and should be describable, equatable, and hashable.
///
/// Conforming types should primarily implement the `description` property and set
/// the values for `startTime` and `endTime`.

  /// Provides a string representation of a rotation event.
  ///
  /// This is primarily used for debugging and also serves as the basis for generating hash values.
