# Overview

ikalendar2 is an iOS app for tracking Splatoon 2 rotation schedules. It's an alternative to Nintendo's official companion app that cuts straight to the point and provides quick access to current rotation information.

# Features

- **Instant access** to rotation schedules with a clean interface
- Seamless **auto-refresh** to keep rotation data always current
- **Smooth animations** and game-inspired visual details
- **Customization options** to suit your needs and playstyle
- Support for **English** and **Japanese**
- Layout optimized for both **iPhone** and **iPad**

# Background

Nintendo's official companion app makes checking rotations unnecessarily tedious. A typical workflow requires navigating through multiple screens, each with slow loading times and a cluttered interface that's prone to misclicks. Such a seemingly trivial task takes as long as **15-25 seconds** on average.

I built ikalendar2 to solve this specific problem. It fetches **only the necessary data** from sources and presents the info **immediately** when you open it - no extra steps or waiting around.

ikalendar2 is written in SwiftUI using modern iOS features and APIs. I tried to capture some of Splatoon's visual style while keeping the interface clean and functional. I polished ikalendar2 into the perfect tool for me as a Splatoon player myself, and I believe it translates well to other players in the same shoes.

# Installation

ikalendar2 is available for download on the App Store for free.

# Website

ikalendar2 has a landing page hosted at [`ikalendar.app`](https://ikalendar.app).

Source code of the site is located [here](https://github.com/notbd/Ikalendar2/tree/main/docs) within the `/docs` directory under current repo.

# Archive

The source code for early versions of ikalendar2 was archived at a [separate repo](https://github.com/notbd/ikalendar-2-archived).

The UI and structure of the app has changed so much that at one point I figured it deserved a rewrite. Around that time I also started to enforce SwiftLint and SwiftFormat to help streamline coding style and practices, so starting fresh with a new repository made a lot of sense to me.
