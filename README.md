# Introduction

**ikalendar2** is an iOS / iPadOS companion app for tracking Splatoon 2 rotation schedules. It helps you stay up-to-date with the latest information effortlessly - unlike the clumsy and sluggish experience on the official app from Nintendo.

A typical workflow on Nintendo's app to check rotation for a specific mode and timeslot would involve clicking through multiple unrelated screens and waiting for things to load (very slowly!) at each step. Coupled with its poor and cluttered navigation design that easily leads to misclicks and going back and forth, such a seemingly trivial task could take as long as **15-25 seconds** on average.

ikalendar2, in contrast, delivers the information that matters to you **immediately** upon launch. It fetches only the necessary data from sources, processes it and presents it through a clean and streamlined interface. Additionally, ikalendar2 offers a proud collection of quality-of-life features and customization options to make your experience enjoyable and personalized.

The app is entirely built in SwiftUI and utilizes some of the latest features and APIs available. It is designed to be fast, modern, user-friendly, with a touch of fun and vibrancy inspired by the game itself.

# Features

- Quick access to Splatoon 2 rotation schedules through a clean, modern interface optimized for both iOS and iPadOS devices.
- Robust **auto-refresh** system ensures the latest rotation information is always available.
- Smooth, game-inspired **animations** and thoughtful details throughout the app for a fun and pleasant experience.
- Extensive **customization options** including alternative stage appearances, app icons, and more.
- Native localization support for **English** and **Japanese**.

# Installation

ikalendar2 is available for download on the App Store for free.
